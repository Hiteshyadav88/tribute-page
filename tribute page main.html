        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam (1931-2015) was an eminent Indian scientist, aerospace engineer, and the 11th
            President of India. Born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he hailed from a modest background. Kalam's brilliance
            in aeronautical engineering led him to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Defense
            Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). He played a pivotal role in India's satellite launch vehicle
            and nuclear weapons programs.</p>

        <p>Known as the "People's President," Kalam was loved for his warm, approachable nature and was a source of
            inspiration for millions, particularly the youth. He authored several books, including the widely acclaimed
            "Wings of Fire," an autobiography chronicling his remarkable journey.</p>

        <p>His vision for a developed India by 2020, coupled with his emphasis on education and innovation, left an
            indelible mark on the nation. Dr. Kalam's sudden passing in 2015 while delivering a lecture in Shillong was
            met with deep sorrow, but his legacy lives on through his contributions to science and his enduring impact
            on generations of Indians.</p>
